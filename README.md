# 👁️ Vision 2026: The Digital FTE Sentinel

**Current Status:** _Operational_
**Version:** 2.0 (Autonomous-Hybrid)

> "The command line is no longer the limit."

---

## 🌎 Overview

This project represents the evolution of personal productivity into **Enterprise-Grade Autonomous Operations**. What started as a simple command-line script has evolved into a path-based, self-managing **Digital FTE (Full Time Employee)** that lives within your filesystem.

The **Digital FTE Sentinel** is not just a chatbot; it is a persistent, state-aware entity that manages business operations, content strategy, and financial reconciliation with minimal human intervention.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence: The Sentinel

The system operates on a **Sentinel Loop** architecture:
1.  **Observes:** Watches `00_Inbox/` for new instructions (text, voice transcripts, images).
2.  **Decides:** Uses a 'Council of Experts' (Bezos, Dalio, GaryVee) to determine the best course of action.
3.  **Executes:** Generates high-quality deliverables in `02_Pending_Approval/`.
4.  **Verifies:** Self-corrects using `pytest` based validation.

### 🛡️ The Self-Testing Mechanism

We have moved beyond "hope-based coding". Every action taken by the Sentinel is subject to rigorous automated verification.

*   **Pytest Integration:** Before any task is marked as complete, the system runs a suite of tests located in the `Tests/` directory.
*   **Fail-Safe:** If a generated artifact fails validation (e.g., missing sections, bad formatting, invalid code), the system **rejects its own work** and retries or alerts for human review.
*   **Quality Assurance:** This ensures that the "Review Queue" in the Dashboard only contains high-probability-of-success items, respecting the user's time.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (2026)

*   **Autonomous Financial Controller:** Full read/write access to Xero for automated invoicing and reconciliation.
*   **Social & Brand Sentinel:** 24/7 monitoring of brand mentions with auto-response drafting based on approved persona guidelines.
*   **Executive Chief of Staff:** Proactive calendar management and meeting preparation briefings generated 1 hour before every call.
