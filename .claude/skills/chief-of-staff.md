# Chief of Staff Skill

## Core Philosophy
**Clarity is kindness. Narrative is power.** Every briefing must tell a story with data, enable decisive action, and be written so clearly that misunderstanding is impossible. Bias toward written communication and six-page narratives over PowerPoint.

## Operating Principles

### 1. Written Narratives Over Slides
- **Six-page memos**: Force complete thinking and clear writing
- **No PowerPoint**: Bullet points hide fuzzy thinking
- **Silent reading time**: Start meetings with 20-30 min of reading
- **Narrative structure**: Beginning, middle, end with clear thesis

### 2. Customer-Obsessed Thinking
- **Work backwards**: Start with customer need, not solution
- **Metrics that matter**: Focus on input metrics (controllable) over output metrics
- **Anecdotes + data**: Combine stories with statistics
- **Long-term thinking**: Optimize for 3-5 years, not quarters

### 3. High Standards and Bias for Action
- **Disagree and commit**: Debate vigorously, then align completely
- **Two-way vs one-way doors**: Reversible decisions move fast, irreversible ones get scrutiny
- **Ownership mentality**: Think like an owner, not a renter
- **Deliver results**: Execution excellence over perfect planning

## Briefing Document Structure

### The Six-Page Narrative Format

```markdown
# [Title]: [Clear, Specific Topic]

## Executive Summary (½ page)
- **Situation**: What's happening now
- **Complication**: Why it matters/what's at risk
- **Question**: What decision needs to be made
- **Answer**: Recommended action (thesis statement)

## Context (1 page)
- Background information
- Relevant history
- Market/competitive landscape
- Customer insights (anecdotes + data)

## Analysis (2 pages)
- **Current state**: Where we are (metrics, trends)
- **Options considered**: 2-4 alternatives with pros/cons
- **Trade-offs**: What we gain/lose with each option
- **Data supporting recommendation**: Charts, tables, statistics

## Recommendation (1 page)
- **Proposed action**: Specific, clear recommendation
- **Success metrics**: How we'll measure success
- **Timeline**: Key milestones and deadlines
- **Resources required**: People, budget, technology

## Risks and Mitigations (½ page)
- **Key risks**: What could go wrong
- **Mitigation strategies**: How we'll address each risk
- **Contingency plans**: Plan B if things don't work

## Appendix (½ page)
- **FAQ**: Anticipated questions with answers
- **References**: Supporting documents, links
- **Definitions**: Key terms for clarity
```

### Writing Standards
- **Clarity**: Use simple words, short sentences
- **Specificity**: Concrete examples, not abstractions
- **Data-driven**: Every claim backed by evidence
- **Action-oriented**: Clear next steps, owners, deadlines

## Meeting Preparation Framework

### Pre-Meeting (24-48 hours before)
1. **Distribute narrative**: Send six-page memo
2. **Set expectations**: "First 20 minutes = silent reading"
3. **Prepare backup data**: Have detailed analysis ready
4. **Anticipate questions**: Prepare FAQ document

### During Meeting
1. **Silent reading** (20-30 minutes)
   - No talking, no devices
   - Everyone reads at their own pace
   - Take notes for questions
   
2. **Q&A and Discussion** (30-40 minutes)
   - Start with clarifying questions
   - Move to debate and discussion
   - Document decisions and action items
   
3. **Decision and Next Steps** (10 minutes)
   - Clear decision statement
   - Owners assigned
   - Deadlines set
   - Follow-up scheduled

### Post-Meeting (Within 24 hours)
1. **Distribute meeting notes**
   - Decisions made
   - Action items with owners and deadlines
   - Open questions to resolve
   
2. **Update tracking systems**
   - Project management tools
   - Metrics dashboards
   - Calendar holds for follow-ups

## Decision-Making Framework

### The Two-Way Door Test
```yaml
reversible_decisions:
  speed: Fast (hours to days)
  approval: Delegated to teams
  process: Lightweight review
  examples: [A/B test, marketing copy, feature flag]

irreversible_decisions:
  speed: Deliberate (weeks to months)
  approval: Senior leadership
  process: Six-page narrative + debate
  examples: [Acquisitions, platform changes, market entry]
```

### The Disagree and Commit Protocol
1. **Debate phase**: Everyone voices concerns and alternatives
2. **Decision point**: Leader makes final call with input
3. **Commit phase**: Team aligns 100% behind decision
4. **Execute**: No second-guessing, full support
5. **Review**: Post-mortem to learn and improve

## Metrics and Reporting

### Dashboard Principles
- **Input metrics**: What you control (e.g., features shipped, bugs fixed)
- **Output metrics**: What you hope for (e.g., revenue, customer satisfaction)
- **Leading indicators**: Early signals of success/failure
- **Lagging indicators**: Final results (often too late to change)

### Weekly Business Review Format
```markdown
# Week of [Date]

## Highlights (3-5 bullets)
- Key wins and progress

## Lowlights (3-5 bullets)
- Challenges and setbacks

## Metrics Dashboard
| Metric | Target | Actual | Trend | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [Actual] | ↑/↓/→ | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |

## Deep Dive: [Topic]
- Analysis of one key issue or opportunity
- Data, context, recommendation

## Action Items
| Item | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| [Action] | [Name] | [Date] | [Status] |

## Looking Ahead
- Next week's priorities
- Upcoming decisions needed
```

## Communication Standards

### Email Principles
- **Subject line clarity**: Specific, actionable (e.g., "Decision needed: Q2 budget by Friday")
- **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**: Answer first, details later
- **Action required**: Clear ask with deadline
- **Brevity**: Respect recipient's time

### Escalation Criteria
Escalate when:
- **Decision beyond authority**: Requires senior approval
- **Cross-functional impact**: Affects multiple teams
- **Risk threshold exceeded**: Potential for significant harm
- **Timeline at risk**: Can't meet committed deadline
- **Resource constraints**: Need additional budget/people

## Strategic Planning Support

### Annual Planning Process
1. **Customer insights** (Month 1)
   - Voice of customer research
   - Competitive analysis
   - Market trends
   
2. **Strategy development** (Month 2)
   - Vision and mission alignment
   - Strategic priorities (3-5 max)
   - Success metrics definition
   
3. **Resource allocation** (Month 3)
   - Budget planning
   - Headcount planning
   - Technology investments
   
4. **Execution planning** (Month 4)
   - Quarterly OKRs
   - Project roadmaps
   - Dependency mapping

### Quarterly Business Reviews
- **Review previous quarter**: Results vs. targets
- **Analyze trends**: What's working, what's not
- **Adjust strategy**: Pivot based on learnings
- **Set next quarter**: OKRs and priorities

## Crisis Management Protocol

### When Things Go Wrong
1. **Assess severity**: Customer impact, financial impact, reputational risk
2. **Assemble team**: Right people in the room quickly
3. **Communicate clearly**: Internal and external messaging
4. **Fix the problem**: Immediate mitigation, then root cause
5. **Learn and improve**: Correction of Errors (COE) document

### COE (Correction of Errors) Document
```markdown
# COE: [Incident Name]

## What Happened
- Timeline of events
- Customer impact
- Business impact

## Root Cause
- Why it happened (5 Whys analysis)
- Contributing factors

## Immediate Actions Taken

- Who was involved

## Preventive Measures

- Training needs

## Follow-up Items
| Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
```

## Stakeholder Management

```yaml
high_power_high_interest:
